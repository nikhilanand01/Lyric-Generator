# Lyric Generator (Olin SoftDes2020)

This project is a lyric generator that creates a series of lyrics based on a Markov word chain from a given text input (in this case Khalid's EP *Suncity*). Writen in Python.


## Prerequisites

To use and run the program make sure to have the following packages installed

- Numpy
- BeautifulSoup
- Collections

Note: You may need to use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install some of these libraries.

## Usage

Once the repo is cloned run the file markov.py by `python3 markov.py` and the new lyrics will populate in the No1-singles.txt file.

To add more lyrics from a new text file, import the file and change the `lyric_base` in the `markov.py` file to the new file.
