are we better off believing
what the ignorance suggests
i wish living life was easy
but mine has been a mess
they say it comes with the seasons
but the seasons come and go they go
i go blurry when i'm thinking
is it me or vertigo criticized who am i to give up
and breathing was the reason to live
sympathize who am i to give up
putting on my favorite record are we alive
or are we dreaming
after the ride
are you living
are we alive
riding this riding in this
or are we dreaming
riding this riding in this
after the ride
are you living
riding this riding in this i've been better often broken
i've been battered up and beat
i wish i was more outspoken
but the words are out of reach
hmm thought i loved you in the moment
i was happy i was not
i've been learning i've been growing
but the worst is yet to come criticized who am i to give up
and breathing was the reason to live
sympathize who am i to give up
putting on my favorite record are we alive
or are we dreaming
after the ride
are you living
are we alive
riding this riding in this
or are we dreaming
riding this riding in this
after the ride
are you living
riding this riding in this eyes closed eyes closed

i've been falling with my saturday nights
new berry cigarillos
swishers make my throat hurt
rolling ocds on the side for me
got 'em up and let 'em both burn
family feuds saying mom's confused
i'm for sure she doesn't wanna learn
but daddy's gone say he's never home
and wishing only makes it worse i guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'cause they'll only know what you let 'em see all the things that i know
that your parents don't
they don't care like i do
know well like i do
and all the things that i know
that your parents don't
they don't care like i do
nowhere like i do
nowhere like i do
nowhere like i do saturday nights
that gray silverado
you drive it 'cause you have to
stay up working late at a job you hate
fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
all my love in the dark clouds
i know what you gotta do
you got plans wrapped in rubber bands
and that's the only thing you'll never lose i guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'cause they'll only know what you let 'em see all the things that i know
that your parents don't
they don't care like i do
nowhere like i do
and all the things that i know
that your parents don't
they don't care like i do
nowhere well like i do
nowhere like i do
nowhere like i do 'cause i care
i care about you
there's nowhere i'd rather be
than right here right now
i care care about you
there's nowhere i'd rather be all the things that i know
that your parents don't
they don't care about you
nowhere that i do
and all the things that i know
that your parents don't
don't care about you
nowhere that i
nowhere that i do
nowhere that i do do do do
nowhere that i do do do do
nowhere that i do do do do verse 1
you'd rather speak more than listen
and that's based off our first impression
i'm new to all this affection
but i'm going in the right direction
floating through different dimensions
but not losing sense of religion
honey i forgot to mention
i'm so entranced by the rhythm chorus
i'm in love with the moment
see me floatin' see me glowin'
i'm in love with the moment
see me floatin' see me glowin' verse 2
can't let me go if i'm fallin'
i've been on the path of importance
let the love pull you in slowly
the river is running we're flowing
i'm coming down you've been rollin'
and we're letting free now we're open
pour me a pour me a potion
i'm rocking i'm rocking the motion chorus
i'm in love with the moment
see me floatin' see me glowin'
i'm in love with the moment
see me floatin' see me glowin' outro
